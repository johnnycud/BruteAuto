BruteQuickAuto} In this assignment,we were implementing an autocomplete interface. Bruteforce was done first, followed by a quicker autocomplete. Because of the amount of time i put into this assignment, i could not give any more time to it with out neglecting other subjects So could not finish the assignment completely, will return to this after the semester.

-What was complete,

AutoComplete interface: Term class: Reads in terms from a data text file saves them to an array. BruteAutocomplete class : Takes in the term array and searchs for best match, the weight of term and all matches Client class: Cli interface driven class, allows user to input a prefix to be searched calling methods from brute auto BruteAutoTest class: two method tests passed

-Other classes (left uncomplete) One of the tests- testmatches kept failing= tried debugging but no luck The client class worked fine funtionality wise, but it had problems when the data file was added to the project the following errors occured that I was unable to solve:


-Installation It was run in an IDE like eclipse

-Usage

-Run AutocompleteClient class to bring up CLI inferface follow the instructions on screen +used IDE eclipse

-History
